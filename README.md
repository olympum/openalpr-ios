openalpr-ios
============

Xcode Framework for the [openalpr](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr) library.

Because openalpr requires Tesseract 3.03, and, as of this writing, that version has not been released yet, it means that we cannot yet use the Tesseract [CocoaPod](http://cocoapods.org).  Instead, this module includes a bash script (based on [this one](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12849517/c-linking-problems-seems-like-i-cant-link-against-standard-c-stuff)) that will compile universal Tesseract 3.03 and Leptonica 1.71 libraries, which can then be used to compile/link openalpr for iOS.

It *[used to be](https://twitter.com/shexbeer/status/466644279667204096)* that getting openalpr working on iOS required that both [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) and [Tesseract](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/) needed to be compiled with `libstdc++` instead of `libc++`.  **This is no longer the case.** OpenCV has more recently begun to be built with `libc++`, so it is possible to use it across the dependencies and in openalpr. (It *does* remain a requirement that the same library is used for all dependencies and openalpr.)

The basic steps to getting openalpr configured on XCode are:

- Clone this module, which includes a template XCode project for a openalpr library and Cocoa Touch Framework.
- Run a script to build the dependencies
- Configure your own XCode project that will use the openalpr Cocoa Touch Framework.

## Steps in Detail

- Get openalpr source:
  ```
  # git clone https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr.git openalpr
  ```

- Clone this module:
  ```
  # git clone git@github.com:twelve17/openalpr-ios.git
  ```

- From the top level `openalpr-ios` git folder, run the `sync_openalpr_source.sh` script, passing the path to whereyou cloned openalpr:
  ```
  # ./bin/sync_from_openalpr_source.sh ~/work/lp/openalpr
  ```
 This script will do the following:
   - Copy openalpr sources and headers to `openalpr-ios/openalpr-xcode/openalpr`, for use by the XCode project.
   - Copy openalpr headers (only) to `openalpr-ios/work/dependencies/include/openalpr`, for use by your own XCode iOS application project.
   - Copy openalpr `runtime_data` folder to `openalpr-ios/work/dependencies/share/openalpr`, for use by your own XCode iOS application project.

- From the top level `openalpr-ios` git folder, run the `build_dependencies.sh` script.  
  ```
  # ./bin/build_dependencies.sh
  ```
  This will compile iOS compatible versions of Leptonica and Tesseract to the prefix `openalpr-ios/work/dependencies`

- The project uses the OpenCV CocoaPod instead of the iOS version from OpenCV site.  Install it via the `pod` command:  
  ```
  # cd openalpr-xcode
  # pod install
  ```
  This will install the `OpenCV` dependency.

- Open the openalpr-ios/openalpr-xcode XCode project as suggested by the CocoaPod docs:
  ```
  # open openalpr-xcode.xcworkspace
  ```
  - As of this writing, the latest openalpr revision was beea8923f6c4671170753b382cc598d76fbf38ff, and it required me to make a couple of manual changes:
    1. Create a file called `version.h` in the `openalpr` folder (in same folder  `main.cpp` is in) to set a few variables that are required, like this:
    ```
    #define OPENALPR_MAJOR_VERSION "1"
    #define OPENALPR_MINOR_VERSION "2"
    #define OPENALPR_PATCH_VERSION "0"
    ```
    This module [includes a copy](https://github.com/twelve17/openalpr-ios/blob/master/etc/version.h) you can use.     The version numbers may be wrong on this file, so feel free to fix them.

## Using the openalpr-xcode Project In Your Own Project

- Go to `<Your Project>` → `Targets` → `<Project>` → `Build Settings`
  - Under `Header Search Paths`, add:
  `/<path_to>/openalpr-ios/work/dependencies/include/openalpr`

- In your project, create a group called `Resources`, below the root node.
  - While having the `openalpr-xcode` project open, browse to `Products`, then drag the `libopenalpr-xcode.a` library to your own project, into the `Resources` group created above.  This should cause a few other things to happen, but you should confirm this:
  - Under `<Your Project>` → `Targets` → `<Project>` → `Build Settings`
    - `Library Search Paths` should now have an entry that looks something like this:
      `$(USER_LIBRARY_DIR)/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/openalpr-xcode-ddcvnkuwwembihfiemhmlsqzmnar/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos`
    - `Link Binary With Libraries` should now have `libopenalpr-xcode.a`.


## Creating the XCode Project From Scratch

- Create Project
  - `Framework & Library` → `Cocoa Touch Static Library`
    - Product Name: `openalpr-xcode`
  - Save under the `openalpr-ios` folder.
  - Delete `openalpr_xcode.h` and `openalpr_xcode.m` (move to trash)
  
- On the left pane, select the `openalpr-xcode` group.
- Go to `File` → `Add files to "openalpr-xcode"`
  - Browse to `/<path_to>/openalpr-ios/openalpr-xcode/openalpr`
  - Select all items in that folder (main.cpp, etc.)
    - Uncheck `Copy items if needed`
    - Under `Added folders`, select `Create groups`

- Quit XCode 

- Create a Podfile on the openalpr-xcode folder:
  ```
platform :ios, '8.1'

source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

pod 'OpenCV'
  ```

- Install the CocoaPods  
  ```
  # cd openalpr-xcode
  # pod install
  ```

- Re-open XCode as suggested by the CocoaPod docs:
  ```
  # open openalpr-xcode.xcworkspace
  ```

- Remove `openalpr-xcodeTests` target by selecting it, then selecting the - at the bottom of the panel.

- Add search path for `openalpr` headers within the Project, as well as 
  `tesseract` and `leptonica` headers.
  - openalpr-xcode -> Targets -> openalpr-xcode -> Build Settings 
  - Search Paths -> Header Search Paths, add: 
    - `$(PROJECT_DIR)/openalpr` (recursive)
    - `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../work/dependencies/include/` (non-recursive)

- Add target for building framework.   Select 'openalpr-xcode' on the navigation panel.  
  - Click on the + at the bottom of the right panel to add a new target.
    - Select iOS -> Framework & Library -> Cocoa Touch Framework
      - Product Name: `openalpr`
      - Select `Finish`
  - The above framework creates an additional `openalprTests` target.  Remove it by selecting the - at the bottom of the panel.


- Browse to `openalpr-xcode` -> `Targets` -> `openalpr` -> `Build Phases`
  - Add libraries to include in the Framework target:
    - `Target Dependencies`, add: `openalpr-xcode` (static library target)
    - `Headers`:  
      - Remove `openalpr.h` by pressing the `-` sign 
      - Add `openalpr/alpr.h` by dragging it from the navigator.
    - `Link Binary With Libraries`
      - `Add Other`.  
      - Browse to `openalpr-ios/work/dependencies/lib`.  
      - Add `libtesseract.a` and `liblept.a`.


- Build library 
  - Select the openalpr-xcode Library from the drop down to the right of the "Play" and "Stop" icons on the top toolbar, left side.
  - Press command-B to build.  Under Products, the libopenalpr-xcode.a should have turned from red to black.
  - Select the openalpr Framework from the drop down to the right of the "Play" and "Stop" icons on the top toolbar, left side.
  - Press command-B to build.  Under Products, the libopenalpr-xcode.a should have turned from red to black.

### TODO

TODO: - Add Info.plist file to openalpr (Framework) target.
TODO: - Set installation directory in openalpr (Framework) target.
 - from /Library/Frameworks to @loader_path/../Frameworks/ 
 - skip install - no?

xxxxx  - openalpr-xcode -> Targets -> openalpr -> Build Phases
  - Link Binary With Libraries, add: 
    - `openalpr-xcode.a`
    - `$(PROJECT_DIR)/openalpr` (recursive)
    - `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../work/dependencies/include/` (non-recursive)
